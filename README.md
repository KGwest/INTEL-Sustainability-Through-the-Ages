Intel Sustainability Journey
Welcome to my Project 2: Intel Sustainability Journey — an interactive webpage I built to showcase Intel’s sustainability goals in a responsive timeline format.

In this project, I explored responsive web design techniques and incorporated hover effects, transitions, and flexible layouts to ensure the site works smoothly across both desktop and mobile devices. I also used AI-assisted tools to support layout decisions and streamline the design process.

Feel free to explore the timeline and see how design and storytelling come together to highlight Intel’s environmental commitments.

I launched and built this project directly in Codespaces.
